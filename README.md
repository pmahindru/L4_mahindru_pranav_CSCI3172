# Lab 4

This is an individual Lab 4 Assignment that was done by me and I didn't take any reference other than Lab 4 documents and recording. I made a select inside div tag and for form which take the input as number and button to check in the HTML and style the page that used in CSS and also used switch cases for the dropdown, they will change the background color as per the value is updated in the select and used the condition for the number input so that we can know about the odd/even and prime/composite and less/greater than in the js. I can show the response on the webpage as well as in the console. All is my code didn't take anything from the outside.
